Architecture        javascript based framework  same as ide               uses the browser native compatabilitffor automatio
              
Object oriented      not                       semi object oriented tool   purely object oriented tool

Dynamic finders      ide doesnt explictly
                     provide dynamic finder     same as ide                 support

speed             it is veryfast as it     slower than webdriver           webdriver communicates direecltl
                                           it doesnot directly 
                                            communicating to browser
